\label{sect:abstract}

The primary goal of the developmental research grant being proposed here to to develop, implement, and test an automated endotracheal intubation robot, which will facilitate safer, more reliable, and more robust intubation procedures. This will be facilitated through a novel form of continuum robot actuation called mechanisms called twisted and coild polymer (TCP) wiring. The research will be broken into five stages; TCP fabrication, kinematic modeling, end effector design, core tubing design, and automation integration. Each part will be discussed more thoroughly in the body of this proposal. Completion of these tasks will shed light on the potential for automated intubation system that exhibits a higher level accuracy and stability than the current standard procedure. The long term goal is to provide professionals with a more reliable alternative to the current intubation systems including the direct and video larygoscopes, and the flexible intubation scope. This is in accordance with the mission of the National Health Institute because of its focus on creating a safer environment for the patient, as well as providing new tools for biomedical research and use.
