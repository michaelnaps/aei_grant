	abstract = {In this paper, a biologically inspired neural network approach to real-time collision-free motion planning of mobile robots or robot manipulators in a nonstationary environment is proposed. Each neuron in the topologically organized neural network has only local connections, whose neural dynamics is characterized by a shunting equation. Thus the computational complexity linearly depends on the neural network size. The real-time robot motion is planned through the dynamic activity landscape of the neural network without any prior knowledge of the dynamic environment, without explicitly searching over the free workspace or the collision paths, and without any learning procedures. Therefore it is computationally efficient. The global stability of the neural network is guaranteed by qualitative analysis and the Lyapunov stability theory. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulation studies.},

	abstract = {We introduce {SE}3-Nets which are deep neural networks designed to model and learn rigid body motion from raw point cloud data. Based only on sequences of depth images along with action vectors and point wise data associations, {SE}3-Nets learn to segment effected object parts and predict their motion resulting from the applied force. Rather than learning point wise flow vectors, {SE}3-Nets predict {SE}(3) transformations for different parts of the scene. Using simulated depth data of a table top scene and a robot manipulator, we show that the structure underlying {SE}3-Nets enables them to generate a far more consistent prediction of object motion than traditional flow based networks. Additional experiments with a depth camera observing a Baxter robot pushing objects on a table show that {SE}3-Nets also work well on real data.},

	abstract = {Twisted and coiled polymers ({TCP}) muscles are linear actuators that respond to change in temperature. Exploiting high negative coefficient of thermal expansion ({CTE}) and helical geometry give them a significant ability to change length in a limited temperature range. Several applications and experimental data of these materials have been demonstrated in the last few years. To use these actuators in robotics and control system applications, a mathematical model for predicting their behavior is essential. In this work, a practical and accurate phenomenological model for estimating the displacement of {TCP} muscles, as a function of the load as well as input electrical current, is proposed. The problem is broken down into two parts, i.e. modeling of the electro-thermal and then the thermo-elastic behavior of the muscles. For the first part, a differential equation, with changing electrical resistance term, is derived. Next, by using a temperature-dependent modulus of elasticity and {CTE} as well as taking the geometry of the muscles into account, an expression for displacement is derived. Experimental data for different loads and actuation current levels are used for verifying the model and investigating its accuracy. The result shows a good agreement between the simulation and experimental results for all loads.},

To date, a wide variety of modelling approaches has been derived to describe the deformations of tendon-driven continuum robots. Motivated by the need for a comprehensive overview of existing methodologies, this work summarizes and outlines state-of-the-art modelling approaches. In particular, the most relevant models are classified based on backbone representations and kinematic as well as static assumptions. Numerical case studies are conducted to compare the performance of representative modelling approaches from the current state-of-the-art, considering varying robot parameters and scenarios. The approaches show different performances in terms of accuracy and computation time. Guidelines for the selection of the most suitable approach for given designs of tendon-driven continuum robots and applications are deduced from these results.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on design, fabrication and characterization of a biomimetic, compact, low-cost and lightweight 3D printed humanoid hand ({TCP} Hand) that is actuated by twisted and coiled polymeric ({TCP}) artificial muscles. The {TCP} muscles were recently introduced and provided unprecedented strain, mechanical work, and lifecycle (Haines et al 2014 Science 343 868–72). The five-fingered humanoid hand is under-actuated and has 16 degrees of freedom ({DOF}) in total (15 for fingers and 1 at the palm). In the under-actuated hand designs, a single actuator provides coupled motions at the phalanges of each finger. Two different designs are presented along with the essential elements consisting of actuators, springs, tendons and guide systems. Experiments were conducted to investigate the performance of the {TCP} muscles in response to the power input (power magnitude, type of wave form such as pulsed or square wave, and pulse duration) and the resulting actuation stroke and force generation. A kinematic model of the flexor tendons was developed to simulate the flexion motion and compare with experimental results. For fast finger movements, short high-power pulses were employed. Finally, we demonstrated the grasping of various objects using the humanoid {TCP} hand showing an array of functions similar to a natural hand.},

	abstract = {A class of innovative artificial muscles made of high-strength polymeric fibers such as fishing lines or sewing threads have been discovered recently. These muscles are fabricated by a simple “twist-insertion” procedure, which have attracted increasing attention due to their low cost and readily availability, giant tensile stroke, record energy density, and easy controllability. In the present paper, we established a multi-scale modeling framework for the thermomechanical actuation responses by a top-down strategy, spanning from macro-scale helical spring analysis down to molecular level chain interaction study. Comparison between modeling results and experimental results exhibited excellent agreement. The effect of the micro-, meso- and macro-scale parameters on the actuation responses of the artificial muscle was further discussed through a parametric study per the validated model. This work helps understand the physical origin behind the remarkable tensile actuation behavior of the twisted-then-coiled polymeric artificial muscles and also provides inspirations for optimal design of advanced artificial muscles made by twist-insertion procedure.},
